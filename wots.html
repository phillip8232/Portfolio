                <p>
                    Wrath of the Stormcaller is a challenging and exciting roguelike 
                    action hack and slash game. You play as a powerful hero fighting through 
                    waves of enemies in a dungeon filled with danger and mystery. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As you battle your way through each level, you'll pick up cards and power-ups that will help 
                    you upgrade your character and improve your chances of survival.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But beware - the minions of the Stormcaller, an evil deity who has brought chaos 
                    and destruction to the land, will stop at nothing to prevent you from reaching their master. 
                    To defeat the Stormcaller and bring an end to the storm, you'll need to use all of your skills 
                    and cunning, as well as the strategic use of weapons and magic, to overcome a variety of obstacles 
                    and challenges.

                <p>
                    when we first began planning the game, it was intended to be a small arena-based game 
                    where the arena slowly closes on you with card power-ups and a level system. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    However, 
                    as we shared our game design with others and received feedback, the scope and vision for 
                    the game grew and evolved over time. One significant change was the decision to hand-build 
                    the arenas in order to create a more immersive and engaging experience for players. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    This change required a significant amount of additional work and effort, but we believed 
                    it will ultimately pay off in the form of a more polished and enjoyable game.

                <!-- Features  -->
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Main Features</h2>
                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Cards</h4>
                <img src="Assets/WrathDocumentation/Card.gif">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Cards are a key feature of Wrath of the Stormcaller, designed to make each playthrough feel unique. 
                    There are many different types of cards available, each of which can enhance the player's abilities, 
                    add strength, or provide support based on their playstyle. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Cards can stack indefinitely, allowing players 
                    to build up powerful combinations that can give them an edge in combat. However, some cards may be removed 
                    from the card pool, ensuring that the game remains balanced and challenging. Overall, the card system is an 
                    integral part of the game's design, providing players with a customizable and dynamic experience.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Skill Artifacts</h4>
                <img src="Assets/WrathDocumentation/SkillArtifact.gif">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Skill artifacts are a special type of item that players can find during their journey through the game.
                    These artifacts provide additional abilities that can help players to overcome obstacles and defeat enemies 
                    in new and creative ways. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As players collect more artifacts, they will be able to feel a sense of growth and 
                    progression, as they unlock new skills and abilities that they can use to become more powerful. Overall, skill 
                    artifacts are a key part of the game's design, providing players with a sense of discovery and empowerment as 
                    they explore the dungeon of Wrath of the Stormcaller.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Dodge Feature / Matrix</h4>
                <img src="Assets/WrathDocumentation/Matrix.gif">
                <br>
                <p>
                    The dodge feature, also known as the Matrix feature, is a key mechanic in Wrath of the Stormcaller 
                    that is designed to reward skilled players. The dodge feature allows players to avoid incoming attacks, 
                    giving them a chance to reposition themselves and strike back at their enemies.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    If players decide they can
                    upgrade the dodge ability to the Matrix level, which introduces a new mechanic that slows down time for enemies. 
                    This allows players to attack their enemies while they are vulnerable, providing a significant advantage 
                    in combat.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To use the Matrix feature, players must time their dodge perfectly, activating the ability just as 
                    an enemy attack is about to hit. Overall, the dodge and Matrix features are an important part of the game's 
                    design, providing players with a higher skill ceiling and a chance to outmaneuver their enemies 
                    in more dynamic ways.
                </p>
                <br>

                <h4 style="text-align: center;">Enemy variety</h4>
                <img src="Assets/WrathDocumentation/EnemyVariety.gif">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Wrath of the Stormcaller features a variety of enemies to battle against, each with its unique abilities, stats, 
                    and mechanics. There are three main types of non-boss enemies in the game: Skeletons, Mages, and Golems.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Each enemy has three levels of difficulty, with the higher levels offering more powerful stats and additional 
                    abilities. Skeletons are the melee-based enemies, while Mages provide ranged attacks. Golems, on the other hand, 
                    are slow but powerful tanks that can absorb a lot of damage. These enemies require different strategies to defeat 
                    and provide players with unique challenges throughout the game. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Additionally, there is a <span style="font-weight: bold;">boss enemy(Stormcaller)</span>, 
                    a powerful mage with a variety of skills, which provides a challenging climax to the game. 
                    Overall, the enemies in Wrath of the Stormcaller provide players with a variety of foes to face and 
                    require different tactics to overcome.

                         In the mid game, players will be more powerful and have unlocked more abilities, 
                         but the levels and enemies will be much harder.

                     <li>
                         To continue getting stronger, players must keep collecting cards, as they will 
                         become increasingly important to progress.

                     <li>
                         The number of enemies will have increased, and they will deal more damage. 
                         For example, skeletons will now be equipped with weapons and do more damage, 
                         while mages will be able to teleport if players get too close.
                     </li>

                     <li>
                         Golems will become more beefy, meaning they will be harder to defeat and deal more damage.

                     <li>
