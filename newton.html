                <p>
                    In Newton's Cube, you will be transported to a sci-fi world where you must use your knowledge of
                     physics to escape the puzzles and challenges of an escape room.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    As you progress through the game, 
                    you'll encounter a range of physics-based scenarios that will test your understanding of real-world 
                    physics concepts.

                <br>
                <p>
                    To help bring our sci-fi world to life, we've explored the Unreal Engine marketplace 
                    for potential game assets that can enhance the immersive experience of Newton's Cube.

                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Why we decided to make the game</h2>
                <p>
                    On average, children aged 5â€“14 spent more than 2 hours each day sitting or lying down 
                    for screen-based activities found in this article

                <!-- Planning -->
                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Planning & Execution</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Making the Right Choice: How We Decided on a Game Engine for Our Project</h4>
                <br>
                <img src="Assets/NewtonDocumentation/DecisionMatrix.png">
                <br>
                <p>
                    We used a decision matrix table to evaluate game engine options based on experience ,3D capabilities, price, 
                    physics capability, and available assets. After considering these factors, we selected Unreal Engine 
                    for its strong 3D capabilities and available assets, despite some team members having less experience 
                    with it. Our careful planning and execution ensured the success of our project.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Finding the Target Audience / Social research</h4>
                <p>
                    To ensure our game resonates with our intended audience, we conducted research to determine who 
                    our target audience is. We considered various factors such as age, gender, interests, and preferences. 
                    We conducted surveys, gathered feedback from focus groups, and analyzed market trends.
                </p>
                <br>

                <img src="Assets/NewtonDocumentation/Chart3.png">
                <br>
                <p>
                    By doing so, we were able to gain valuable insights into our target audience and tailor our game accordingly. 
                    Our goal was to create an experience that not only educates but also engages and entertains our target audience. 
                    The process of finding the target audience helped us to ensure that our game meets the needs of our intended 
                    audience and offers an enjoyable and educational experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Topics we decided to use for our game</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Newton's Law</li>
                    <li>Momentum</li>
                    <li>Projectile Motion</li>
                    <li>Energy</li>
                    <li>Electricity</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h4>Gamification Process</h4>
                <p>
                    As part of our gamification process, we transformed complex physics topics into a 
                    real escape room puzzle game. We carefully planned out each level and studied each topic to ensure that 
                    the puzzles accurately represented the principles of physics.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    To provide players with assistance in case 
                    they get stuck, we also created a <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Q6uA54mjhT4VTwuj08-qzygznboMuOvDl0ZRu5VkNm4/edit#">user manual</a></b> that offers helpful tips and guidance. Our goal was to create 
                    an interactive and engaging experience that not only taught physics concepts but also encouraged critical 
                    thinking and problem-solving skills. By providing players with a user manual, we hope to help them overcome 
                    any obstacles they may encounter in the game and ensure they have an enjoyable and educational experience.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Level Design</h4>
                <p>
                    When it came to designing the levels for our game, we used the same engine that we planned to use for the 
                    final product. By doing so, we were able to create accurate 1 to 1 scale mock-ups of each level, which allowed 
                    us to plan out the interactions and functionality without the need for coding.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We also implemented a peer-review process, where each team member reviewed and critiqued each other's 
                    level designs to ensure that they met our standards for quality and engagement. By carefully designing 
                    each level, we aimed to create an immersive and challenging experience that would reinforce the physics 
                    concepts that we wanted to teach
                </p>
